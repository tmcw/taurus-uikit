# taurus-uikit

iOS UIKit version of [taurus](https://github.com/tmcw/taurus). Previously I implemented this in SwiftUI, which did not work well _at all_. This is in UIKit, which I am more optimistic about.

I'm not an iOS/Swift/UIKit expert by any stretch of the imagination - barely a novice. Any improvements very welcome.
